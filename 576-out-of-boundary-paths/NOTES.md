### Implementation
- Use two 2D vector to store how many ball are in current block and how many ball will in the block later
- For every iteration, check all the block if there are balls, run maxMove times to make sure all number of movement has been checked
​
### Complexity
- O(Mmn) in time
- O(mn) in extra space
