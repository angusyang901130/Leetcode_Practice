### Implementation
- Set left pole position and right pole position to the left most pole and the right most pole
- If right pole is lower than left pole, then right pole slides left, otherwise left pole slides right
- If wide of the area times the max length of the pole is smaller the max area gotten previously, could return earlier, otherwise update max area 

### Complexity
- O(n) in time
- O(n) in space
